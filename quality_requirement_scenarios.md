# Quality scenarios for Schedules module

Task:
```
Describe 2*n quality requirement scenarios for at least n quality dimensions.
n = number of team members
>= n/2 quality requirements in design-time dimensions
modifiability, testability, interoperability
<= 3*n/2 quality requirements in run-time dimensions
performance, availability, scalability, security
For each scenario, decide if the architecture needs to be updated.
Use the tactics from the lecture.
If yes, update the C4 model and explain
If not, explain why the current architecture can fulfill the scenario
```
## Availability
## Performance
## Security
## Scalability
## Modifiability
## Testability
## Interoperability
